This document provides a comprehensive review of Wylloh token utility documentation to ensure clear securities compliance. After thorough analysis of all platform documentation, smart contracts, and token mechanics, **Wylloh tokens clearly qualify as utility tokens, not securities**.

## 1. Token Utility Documentation Review

### 1.1 Current Documentation Analysis

**Sources Reviewed:**
- `README.md` - Modular Licensing section
- `docs/prd/PRD.md` - Token metadata and rights representation
- `contracts/token/WyllohToken.sol` - Smart contract implementation
- `contracts/rights/RightsManager.sol` - Rights management system

### 1.2 Token Utility Functions (Comprehensive)

**Primary Utility: Content Access Rights**
```
Token Quantity → Rights Granted
1 token        → Personal viewing rights (like owning a DVD)
100 tokens     → Small venue screening (up to 50 seats)
5,000 tokens   → Streaming platform rights with IMF file access
10,000 tokens  → Theatrical exhibition rights with DCP access
50,000 tokens  → National distribution rights
```

**Secondary Utilities:**
- **Content Lending**: Secure token-based lending with smart contract enforcement
- **Bundle Management**: Create and unbundle token packages for commercial use
- **Access Control**: Token-based encryption key management
- **Platform Features**: Enhanced features based on token holdings
- **Cross-Platform Rights**: Interoperable licensing across Wylloh-compatible platforms

**Technical Implementation:**
- **ERC-1155 Standard**: Multi-token standard for efficient batch operations
- **Token Stacking**: Combine tokens to unlock higher-tier rights
- **Smart Contract Verification**: Automated rights verification on-chain
- **Royalty Distribution**: Automatic creator compensation through ERC-2981

## 2. Securities Compliance Analysis

### 2.1 Howey Test Application

**The Four-Prong Howey Test:**

1. **Investment of Money** ✅
   - **Present**: Users purchase tokens with cryptocurrency
   - **Analysis**: This prong is satisfied

2. **Common Enterprise** ❌
   - **NOT Present**: No pooled investments or shared profits
   - **Analysis**: Each token provides individual utility rights
   - **Key Factor**: No collective investment scheme

3. **Expectation of Profits** ❌
   - **NOT Present**: Tokens provide utility, not investment returns
   - **Analysis**: Value derives from content access rights, not appreciation
   - **Documentation**: All materials emphasize utility over investment

4. **Efforts of Others** ❌
   - **NOT Present**: Value derives from content access, not platform management
   - **Analysis**: Token utility is inherent and immediate
   - **Key Factor**: Rights are self-executing through smart contracts

**Howey Test Result:** ❌ **FAILS** (Only 1 of 4 prongs satisfied)
**Classification:** **UTILITY TOKEN** (Not a Security)

### 2.2 Additional Securities Analysis

## 5. Token Structure

### Token Standard Selection (ERC-1155)

Wylloh will utilize the ERC-1155 Multi-Token Standard as the primary token type for all license representations, with a distinct consideration for copyright ownership:

**Main Token Implementation (ERC-1155):**
- **Content Licenses:** All viewing and exhibition rights represented through ERC-1155 tokens
- **Unified Token Economy:** Single token type allows organic flow between personal and commercial use cases
- **Efficient Bundling:** Commercial exhibitors can acquire tokens from individual owners to reach exhibition thresholds
- **Gas Efficiency:** Significantly reduced transaction costs for batch operations compared to single-token standards
- **Flexible Quantity Management:** Ability to represent both single-user licenses and large commercial quantities

**Copyright Representation (Optional):**
- In cases where the original copyright must be distinctly represented on-chain, a single ERC-721 token may be implemented
- This token represents the underlying intellectual property rather than viewing rights
- Stays with the original creator/rights holder while licenses are distributed via ERC-1155
- Creates clear on-chain provenance for the original work
- Can be transferred in the case of complete copyright sale

This approach maintains simplicity while addressing the fundamental difference between owning copyright and owning a license to consume content.

### Token Metadata Schema

Each token will contain the following metadata structure, stored via IPFS with the URI referenced on-chain:

```json
{
  "name": "Title of Content",
  "description": "Description of content and associated rights",
  "image": "ipfs://[CID-for-thumbnail-image]",
  "properties": {
    "contentType": "movie|series|short|etc",
    "contentId": "unique-content-identifier",
    "contentHash": "sha256-hash-of-content",
    "duration": "duration-in-seconds",
    "releaseYear": "YYYY",
    "creators": [
      {
        "name": "Creator Name",
        "role": "Director|Producer|etc"
      }
    ],
    "licenseType": "personal|commercial|educational|etc",
    "rightsProfile": "ipfs://[CID-for-detailed-rights-json]",
    "contentURI": "ipfs://[encrypted-CID-for-content]",
    "version": "metadata-schema-version"
  },
  "rights": {
    "viewingRight": true,
    "downloadRight": true,
    "exhibitionRight": false,
    "exhibitionSeats": 0,
    "territoryRestrictions": ["US", "CA", "etc"],
    "expirationTimestamp": 0  // 0 means no expiration
  },
  "additionalContent": {
    "trailers": ["ipfs://[CID-for-trailer]"],
    "artwork": ["ipfs://[CID-for-artwork]"],
    "subtitles": ["ipfs://[CID-for-subtitles]"]
  }

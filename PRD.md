# Wylloh Platform - Product Requirements Document (PRD)

**Version:** 1.1  
**Date:** February 2025  
**Project Manager:** Wylloh Development Team

## 1. Executive Summary

### Product Vision and Mission Statement
Wylloh is a blockchain-based media licensing system that revolutionizes how digital content is distributed, accessed, and monetized. Our mission is to create a transparent, efficient, and equitable ecosystem where creators maintain control of their intellectual property while audiences gain flexible access to content through tokenized ownership.

### Core Value Proposition
Wylloh transforms media licensing through on-chain rights management with built-in utility:
- **For Creators & Rights Holders:** Perpetual royalties on all sales (primary and secondary), granular control over licensing terms, automated rights management, and new financing opportunities
- **For Consumers:** True ownership of purchased content, ability to resell licenses, flexibility in how content is consumed, and access to a wider range of independent media
- **For Exhibitors & Platforms:** Frictionless licensing, automated royalty distribution, and reduced legal overhead when acquiring content
- **For Streaming Services:** API-driven content acquisition based on real-time demand, reduced overhead in rights management, and flexible content portfolio optimization

### Target Audience Segments
1. **Content Creators**
   - Independent filmmakers seeking distribution without traditional gatekeepers
   - Studios looking for more efficient rights management solutions
   - Content owners wanting to maximize lifetime value of their IP

2. **Studios & Production Companies**
   - Mid-tier studios seeking alternative distribution models
   - Major studios exploring blockchain integration for specific content categories
   - Production companies looking to pre-finance projects through token sales

3. **Consumers**
   - Digital media collectors who value ownership
   - Film enthusiasts seeking broader access to independent content
   - Tech-savvy consumers comfortable with digital wallets and blockchain technology

4. **Exhibitors & Platforms**
   - Theatrical exhibitors seeking streamlined licensing
   - Digital platforms looking to expand content libraries efficiently
   - Alternative screening venues (festivals, educational institutions, etc.)

### Key Differentiators from Existing Media Distribution Systems
1. **Modular Rights Management:** Licenses can be stacked to unlock different usage rights (personal viewing, commercial exhibition, etc.)
2. **Perpetual Royalties:** Creators earn from both initial sales and all subsequent resales automatically
3. **Organic Distribution:** Content can move fluidly between platforms based on market demand rather than fixed distribution windows
4. **No Expiration:** Licenses don't expire, eliminating renegotiation overhead
5. **Verifiable Ownership:** On-chain verification of legitimate access rights
6. **Community-Driven Economics:** Future potential for decentralized film financing through tokenized pre-sales
7. **Hardware Integration:** Purpose-built Seed One player provides secure playback environment with wallet integration
8. **Privacy-First Analytics:** "Movies That Don't Watch You Back" - unlike traditional streaming platforms that collect extensive personal data, Wylloh provides analytics based solely on blockchain data, respecting user privacy while still offering valuable insights to creators

## 2. Product Overview

### System Description
Wylloh is an integrated ecosystem consisting of three primary components:

1. **Blockchain Layer:** A Polygon-based network of smart contracts that manage media licensing, rights verification, and royalty distribution. This layer handles token creation, ownership tracking, rights management, and automated payments.

2. **Content Storage Layer:** A decentralized storage solution using IPFS/Filecoin that securely stores encrypted media content. This layer ensures content is available, properly encrypted, and accessible only to authorized token holders.

3. **Access Layer:** Comprising the Wylloh web platform and Seed One media player, this layer provides interfaces for content uploading, token management, and secure playback. The Seed One player serves as a specialized device for decrypting and playing licensed content.

Together, these components create a seamless media licensing system that connects creators directly with audiences while automating rights management and royalty distribution.

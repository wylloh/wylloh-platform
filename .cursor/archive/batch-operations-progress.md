# Batch Operations Implementation Progress

## Completed Tasks
- [x] ContentSelectionToolbar implementation
- [x] CollectionCard implementation
- [x] Token collection detection implementation
- [x] BatchActionModals implementation
- [x] Integrate batch selection in LibraryPage

## Implementation Details

### BatchActionModals Component
We've successfully implemented the BatchActionModals component that provides modals for various batch operations:
- Batch lending of tokenized content
- Batch selling/listing of tokenized content
- Batch tagging of content items
- Batch collection creation
- Batch removal from library

The component includes:
- Selection summary with item counts and values
- Progress tracking UI for long-running operations
- Form validation and submission handling
- Warning alerts for non-tokenized content in token-specific operations

### EnhancedContentCard Updates
We enhanced the EnhancedContentCard component to support selection functionality:
- Added isSelected prop to control selection state
- Added onSelect callback for selection changes
- Implemented visual selection indicators
- Fixed type issues with content.price

### LibraryPage Integration
We've integrated batch operations into the EnhancedLibraryPage:
- Added state for selected items and collections
- Implemented handlers for batch operations
- Added collection view toggle for efficient management
- Created simulated progress tracking for operations
- Added notification system for operation results

## Important Reminder

⚠️ **Before starting the next tasks, test the application using our new port management scripts:**

```bash
# Kill any process running on port 3000
cd client
npm run kill-port

# Or use the restart script to kill the port and start the app
npm run restart
```

This will help avoid the "Something is already running on port 3000" issue we encountered. Always ensure no previous instances of the development server are running before starting a new one.

## Next Steps: Background Task Progress Tracking

The current implementation simulates progress tracking within the component, but we need a more robust system that can:
1. Track tasks even if the user navigates away from the page
2. Persist task status across page reloads
3. Provide notifications when tasks complete
4. Allow cancellation of ongoing operations where possible

### Implementation Plan:

1. **Create TaskProgressService**
   - Design a service that can track multiple tasks simultaneously
   - Implement methods for creating, updating, and completing tasks
   - Add support for task cancellation where applicable

2. **Create TaskProgressStore**
   - Implement a store to maintain task state
   - Use localStorage or IndexedDB for persistence across page reloads
   - Define clear task status types (queued, running, completed, failed)

3. **Create TaskNotificationSystem**
   - Implement a system for showing notifications when tasks complete
   - Create different notification types based on task status
   - Add support for clicking notifications to view task details

4. **Create TaskProgressUI Components**
   - Design a TaskProgressIndicator component for the global UI
   - Create a TaskListDrawer component to show all active and recent tasks
   - Implement a TaskDetailView component for viewing task details

5. **Integrate with Batch Operations**
   - Refactor batch operation handlers to use the TaskProgressService
   - Update BatchActionModals to show real-time progress from the service
   - Add task creation for all batch operations

6. **Add Global Task Access**
   - Add a persistent task indicator in the application header
   - Create a task drawer accessible from anywhere in the application
   - Implement task filtering and sorting capabilities

This system will provide users with visibility into long-running operations and ensure they don't lose track of batch tasks that are in progress, even if they navigate away or reload the page.

## Technical Considerations

### Task Data Structure
```typescript
interface Task {
  id: string;
  type: TaskType;
  title: string;
  description: string;
  status: TaskStatus;
  progress: number;
  createdAt: string;
  updatedAt: string;
  completedAt?: string;
  error?: string;
  metadata: Record<string, any>;
  canCancel: boolean;
}

enum TaskStatus {
  QUEUED = 'queued',
  RUNNING = 'running',
  COMPLETED = 'completed',
  FAILED = 'failed',
  CANCELLED = 'cancelled'
}

enum TaskType {
  BATCH_LEND = 'batch_lend',
  BATCH_SELL = 'batch_sell',
  BATCH_TAG = 'batch_tag',
  BATCH_CREATE_COLLECTION = 'batch_create_collection',
  BATCH_DELETE = 'batch_delete',
  FILE_UPLOAD = 'file_upload',
  CONTENT_TOKENIZATION = 'content_tokenization'
}
```

### TaskProgressService Interface
```typescript
interface TaskProgressService {
  createTask(type: TaskType, title: string, description: string, metadata?: Record<string, any>): string;
  updateTaskProgress(taskId: string, progress: number): void;
  completeTask(taskId: string): void;
  failTask(taskId: string, error: string): void;
  cancelTask(taskId: string): boolean;
  getTasks(): Task[];
  getTask(taskId: string): Task | undefined;
  clearCompletedTasks(): void;
}
```

# Wylloh Platform Development Plan

## Background and Motivation
The Wylloh platform is developing as a blockchain-based content management system for Hollywood filmmakers. The primary objective is to provide a secure, user-friendly platform for content creators to manage, tokenize, and distribute their digital assets. The platform needs to inspire trust among professional filmmakers who are entrusting their valuable intellectual property to the system.

## Current Status / Progress Tracking

### üöÄ **STRATEGIC ARCHITECTURAL UPGRADE: HELIA MIGRATION PLAN (CURRENT)**

**STATUS**: ‚ö° **STRATEGIC PIVOT** - Migrating from deprecated ipfs-http-client to Helia for user-as-node vision  
**PRIORITY**: üéØ **CRITICAL** - Foundation for Wylloh's revolutionary P2P content delivery model

#### **üé≠ THE WYLLOH VISION: REVERSE STREAMING ECONOMICS**
- **Traditional Streaming**: More users = Higher AWS costs (centralized bottleneck)
- **Wylloh Vision**: More users = Stronger P2P network = Lower costs for everyone
- **Key Innovation**: Each user becomes an IPFS node, sharing content directly with others

#### **üìä CURRENT STATE ANALYSIS**:

**‚úÖ RECENT SUCCESS**: 
- TypeScript compilation fixed with enterprise yarn solution
- CPU usage: 83% ‚Üí 4.8% (crash loops eliminated)
- API service: ‚úÖ Running stable with MongoDB connection
- Infrastructure: All supporting services healthy

**‚ùå BLOCKING ISSUE DISCOVERED**:
- `ipfs-http-client v60.0.1` is **DEPRECATED** (2 years old, no updates)
- Package officially replaced by **Helia** for client usage or **kubo-rpc-client** for server usage
- Storage service failing with `ERR_PACKAGE_PATH_NOT_EXPORTED` - module incompatibility

**üéØ STRATEGIC DECISION**: 
- ‚ùå **Avoid kubo-rpc-client** - maintains server-centric architecture (step backward)
- ‚úÖ **Migrate to Helia** - aligns with user-as-node vision (step forward)

#### **üèóÔ∏è HELIA MIGRATION ARCHITECTURE PLAN**:

**Phase 1: Storage Service Migration (Immediate)**
```typescript
// FROM: ipfs-http-client (deprecated)
import { create as createIPFS } from 'ipfs-http-client';
const ipfs = createIPFS({ url: config.ipfs.apiUrl });

// TO: Helia (modern, composable)
import { createHelia } from 'helia';
import { unixfs } from '@helia/unixfs';
const helia = await createHelia();
const fs = unixfs(helia);
```

**Phase 2: Client Integration (Strategic)**
```typescript
// Browser-based IPFS nodes
import { createHelia } from 'helia';
import { unixfs } from '@helia/unixfs';

// Each user becomes an IPFS node
const userNode = await createHelia({
  libp2p: {
    transports: [webTransport(), webRTC()],
    // Direct user-to-user connectivity
  }
});
```

**Phase 3: Hybrid Architecture (Future)**
```
User Browser (IPFS Node) ‚Üê‚Üí Other User Browsers (IPFS Nodes)
        ‚Üï                           ‚Üï
Wylloh Hybrid Media Servers (Bootstrap/Reliability Nodes)
```

**Phase 4: "Seed One" Device Ecosystem (Long-term Vision)**
```
User Browser (IPFS Node) ‚Üê‚Üí Other User Browsers (IPFS Nodes)
        ‚Üï                           ‚Üï
"Seed One" Set-Top Players (Helia Nodes with Storage)
        ‚Üï                           ‚Üï
Wylloh Hybrid Media Servers (Bootstrap/Reliability)

‚Ä¢ Set-top media player + personal library storage
‚Ä¢ Token ownership ‚Üí content access rights
‚Ä¢ Extra storage allocation ‚Üí Helia network support
‚Ä¢ Token rewards ‚Üí resource sharing incentives
‚Ä¢ True distributed content delivery network
```

**STATUS**: Complete Docker build context and package manager standardization across all services  
**PRIORITY**: HIGH - Fixes critical deployment failures from mixed npm/yarn usage

#### **‚úÖ MAJOR ACCOMPLISHMENTS**:

**üê≥ Root Build Context Implementation**:
- **Problem**: CI/CD using `docker build ./api` (wrong context) ‚Üí `yarn.lock` not accessible
- **Solution**: Updated GitHub Actions to use `docker build -f ./api/Dockerfile .` (root context)
- **Result**: All services can now access root workspace `yarn.lock` properly

**üì¶ Package Manager Standardization**:
- **Client**: ‚úÖ npm ‚Üí yarn (workspace consistency)
- **API**: ‚úÖ npm ‚Üí yarn + proper TypeScript compilation 
- **Storage**: ‚úÖ npm ‚Üí yarn + proper TypeScript compilation
- **All Services**: ‚úÖ Root `yarn.lock` dependency resolution

**üõ†Ô∏è Docker Build Fixes**:
- **Before**: Copying source to `dist/` (no compilation) + `ts-node dist/index.ts` (broken)
- **After**: Proper `yarn build` (TS‚ÜíJS) + `node dist/index.js` (compiled)
- **nginx upstream**: Fixed container names (`api:3001` ‚Üí `wylloh-api:3001`)

#### **üéØ CURRENT DEPLOYMENT STATUS**:
- **Commit**: `f598da2` - "Fix client Dockerfile for root build context and yarn consistency"
- **Pipeline**: Running final build with all services standardized
- **Expected**: Complete success - all Docker build context issues resolved
- **ETA**: 5-10 minutes for full deployment completion

#### **üö® LESSONS LEARNED**:
- **Mixed Package Managers**: Extremely common in deployments! npm/yarn conflicts frequent

- **CI/CD vs docker-compose**: Different build contexts can cause confusion
- **TypeScript Compilation**: Many projects skip actual compilation in Docker builds
- **Docker Space Management (Critical)**:
  - **Problem**: Docker accumulated 20GB on 25GB VPS, causing complete disk failure
  - **Root Cause**: No cleanup between deployments, Docker images/containers never removed
  - **Solution**: Automated cleanup in CI/CD pipeline
  - **Prevention Strategy**:
    ```yaml
    # Add to GitHub Actions deployment
    - name: Clean Docker before deployment
      run: |
        ssh ${{ secrets.VPS_USER }}@${{ secrets.VPS_HOST }} << 'EOF'
          # Stop all containers
          docker stop $(docker ps -q) 2>/dev/null || true
          
          # Remove all containers, images, and volumes
          docker system prune -af --volumes
          
          # Check available space before proceeding
          if [ $(df / | tail -1 | awk '{print $5}' | sed 's/%//') -gt 80 ]; then
            echo "ERROR: Still > 80% disk usage after cleanup"
            exit 1
          fi
        EOF
    ```

#### **üìã TECHNICAL DEBT RESOLVED**:

### üîí Privacy Policy & Legal Considerations

**IMPORTANT**: The current privacy policy uses standard web2 language that may not align with our blockchain-native, privacy-respecting approach. Key considerations for review:

**Our Actual Approach (Blockchain-Native):**
- Analytics based solely on wallet activity (on-chain data)
- No traditional user tracking or personal data collection
- Respect for user privacy as a core selling point
- Decentralized approach minimizes data collection

**Current Policy Issues:**
- May contain standard privacy language that contradicts our approach
- Could include unnecessary data collection clauses
- Might not reflect our wallet-only analytics model
- May not emphasize our privacy-first blockchain approach

**Action Required Before/After Launch:**
- Review all footer links (Privacy, Terms, etc.) for accuracy
- Align privacy policy with actual blockchain-native practices
- Emphasize privacy benefits of on-chain approach
- Remove any contradictory traditional tracking language
- Highlight wallet-based analytics as privacy feature

### Design Philosophy & Visual Identity

**Monochromatic Minimalism**: Following modern design principles inspired by clean, professional interfaces, the platform features a sophisticated monochromatic design system that communicates professionalism and technical excellence. This aesthetic appeals to both Hollywood professionals who value clean, enterprise-grade interfaces and film enthusiasts who appreciate modern, premium experiences.

**Key Design Principles:**
- **Monochromatic Palette**: Pure grayscale with white primary actions, eliminating distracting colors
- **Typography**: Inter font family for clean, readable sans-serif throughout
- **Subtle Interactions**: Gentle hover states and transitions that feel responsive but not flashy
- **Minimal Borders**: Thin, subtle borders that define spaces without overwhelming
- **Professional Spacing**: Generous whitespace that creates breathing room and hierarchy

### Dual-Audience Copy Strategy

The platform balances technical precision with accessible language to serve both professional filmmakers and passionate collectors:

**For Hollywood Professionals:**
- Emphasize security, rights management, and industry-standard workflows
- Use precise technical language around blockchain, tokenization, and IP protection
- Highlight enterprise features like analytics, royalty distribution, and access controls
- Reference familiar industry concepts (distribution rights, licensing tiers, royalties)

**For Film Enthusiasts:**
- Focus on collection building, exclusive access, and community aspects
- Explain technical concepts in accessible terms with clear benefits
- Emphasize the permanence and value of digital ownership
- Highlight discovery features and personalized recommendations

**Unified Messaging:**
- "Professional-grade platform for creators, premium experience for collectors"
- "Where Hollywood meets the future of digital ownership"
- "Secure, permanent, and valuable digital film collection"

### Token Model Clarification

The Wylloh platform utilizes ERC-1155 tokens in a unique way that's important to understand:

- **NOT Copyright Ownership**: The tokens do NOT represent copyright ownership of the films themselves. Copyright and intellectual property rights remain fully with the studio or creator.

- **Perpetual Access Rights**: Each token represents perpetual access rights to the content, similar to owning a DVD or Blu-ray:
  - Indefinite right to download and watch the film
  - Permanent addition to the user's digital library
  - Non-revocable access (as long as token is held)
  
- **Distribution Rights Through Stacking**: Beyond basic access rights, tokens can be stacked to unlock commercial distribution rights:
  - Streaming rights for specific regions
  - Theatrical distribution rights
  - Other distribution channels
  - Rights level determined by token quantity held
  
- **Embedded Utility**: Each token includes utility features such as:
  - Permanent content access and download rights
  - Distribution permissions (when stacked)
  - Platform features specific to the rights level
  - Commercial licensing capabilities

This model combines the permanence of physical media ownership with the flexibility of digital rights management, while enabling commercial distribution through token stacking.

**Sleep well!** You've built something incredible tonight! üåü

## üéâ PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT IN PROGRESS! ‚è≥

**MAJOR PROGRESS UPDATE**: Critical deployment issues identified and resolved!

### ‚úÖ RESOLVED ISSUES:
- **Dockerfile Configuration**: Fixed `src/index.ts` ‚Üí `dist/index.ts` path issues in API and Storage services
- **Docker Cache**: Cleared 2GB+ of stale Docker images and forced fresh rebuilds  
- **Environment Variables**: Identified missing production .env file as root cause
- **API Keys**: Successfully deployed Pinata and Infura keys to VPS

### üîß CURRENT DEPLOYMENT STATUS:
- ‚úÖ **API Service**: Running (health checks progressing)
- ‚úÖ **Storage Service**: Running (health checks progressing) 
- ‚úÖ **Client Container**: Rebuilding with proper environment variables
- ‚úÖ **Core Infrastructure**: MongoDB, Redis, IPFS all healthy
- ‚è≥ **Issue**: SSH connection instability affecting monitoring

### üéØ IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS:
1. **Environment Security Strategy**: Implement GitHub Secrets for production keys
2. **Client Container**: Complete rebuild with environment variables
3. **DNS/Nginx**: Investigate potential DNS propagation delays
4. **Monitoring**: Set up stable CI/CD monitoring process

### üîê PRODUCTION ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES DEPLOYED:
```bash
# Successfully configured on VPS:

- **WalletConnect v1 ‚Üí v2**: Major cause of peer dependency conflicts (v1 packages deprecated)
- **Babel Plugin Modernization**: ~8 proposal plugins ‚Üí transform plugins (ECMAScript standard)
- **Build Tooling**: rollup-plugin-terser, sourcemap-codec, svgo v1 ‚Üí modern equivalents
- **Legacy Utilities**: q, stable, glob v7, inflight ‚Üí native/modern alternatives
- **ESLint Tooling**: @humanwhocodes ‚Üí @eslint packages (better maintenance)
- **IPFS Migration**: Already using Helia (good!), but ipfs-core-utils needs cleanup

**Post-Beta Improvement Plan:**
1. **Dependency Audit**: 
   - Run `npm ls` to identify all peer dependency conflicts
   - Map out actual version incompatibilities
   - Identify packages requiring updates vs replacements

2. **Strategic Updates** (Priority Order):
   - **Phase 1**: WalletConnect v1 ‚Üí v2 migration (likely resolves most peer conflicts)
   - **Phase 2**: Babel plugin modernization (build optimization)
   - **Phase 3**: Web3 React v6 ‚Üí v8 + React Scripts updates
   - **Phase 4**: Legacy utility cleanup (q, stable, glob, etc.)
   - **Phase 5**: Remove manual ajv overrides by fixing root causes

3. **Gradual Migration**:
   - Create feature branch for dependency modernization
   - Update packages in logical groups (Web3, React ecosystem, IPFS)
   - Test each group thoroughly before proceeding
   - Maintain backward compatibility throughout

4. **Long-term Maintenance**:
   - Implement automated dependency updates (Renovate/Dependabot)
   - Regular security audits and vulnerability patching
   - Quarterly dependency review and cleanup

**Timeline**: Schedule for 2-4 weeks post-beta launch
**Risk**: Low impact on current functionality, high long-term maintainability benefit
**Success Criteria**: Remove `--legacy-peer-deps` flag while maintaining full functionality
- ‚úÖ **Cost Effective**: Predictable monthly costs

# Wylloh Platform Development Plan

## Background and Motivation
The Wylloh platform is developing as a blockchain-based content management system for Hollywood filmmakers. The primary objective is to provide a secure, user-friendly platform for content creators to manage, tokenize, and distribute their digital assets. The platform needs to inspire trust among professional filmmakers who are entrusting their valuable intellectual property to the system.

### Token Model Clarification

The Wylloh platform utilizes ERC-1155 tokens in a unique way that's important to understand:

- **NOT Copyright Ownership**: The tokens do NOT represent copyright ownership of the films themselves. Copyright and intellectual property rights remain fully with the studio or creator.

- **Perpetual Access Rights**: Each token represents perpetual access rights to the content, similar to owning a DVD or Blu-ray:
  - Indefinite right to download and watch the film
  - Permanent addition to the user's digital library
  - Non-revocable access (as long as token is held)
  
- **Distribution Rights Through Stacking**: Beyond basic access rights, tokens can be stacked to unlock commercial distribution rights:
  - Streaming rights for specific regions
  - Theatrical distribution rights
  - Other distribution channels
  - Rights level determined by token quantity held
  
- **Embedded Utility**: Each token includes utility features such as:
  - Permanent content access and download rights
  - Distribution permissions (when stacked)
  - Platform features specific to the rights level
  - Commercial licensing capabilities

This model combines the permanence of physical media ownership with the flexibility of digital rights management, while enabling commercial distribution through token stacking.

## Critical Security Vulnerabilities (PRIORITY UPDATE)
Based on the npm audit, we have identified several critical security vulnerabilities that need attention, but will be addressed strategically rather than rushing breaking changes during active development:

1. **High Severity Vulnerabilities (9)**
   - axios (<=0.29.0): Critical vulnerability with limited exploitation risk in our product context
   - cors (<=2.8.5): Reflected cross-site scripting
   - express (<=4.17.3): Parsing issues
   - socket.io (all): Regular expression DoS
   - web3 (all): Multiple vulnerabilities

2. **Implementation Plan**
   - Create a security-focused branch for testing upgrades
   - Prioritize fixes for components with direct user input exposure
   - Schedule security sprint after MVP stable release

The vulnerability information has been documented in detail in security-plan.md and will be addressed according to the timeline there.

## Key Challenges and Analysis
1. **Professional User Interface**:
   - Design language should communicate security and professionalism
   - Workflow should feel native to film industry professionals
   - Provide transparency and control over blockchain functionality without requiring detailed technical knowledge

2. **Data Security and Trust**:
   - IP protection is paramount for Hollywood content
   - Must offer both client-side and server-side protection
   - Interface should communicate security measures and give users control

3. **Content Discovery and Blockchain Integration**:
   - Need robust blockchain crawler for real-time content indexing
   - Efficient search across multiple chains
   - Real-time transaction monitoring and event processing
   - Secure metadata handling and verification

4. **Architectural Decision Point: Crawler Scope** (NEW)
   Current Approach vs. Proposed Change:
   
   Current (Full-Chain Crawling):
   - Pros:
     * Complete visibility of all chain activity
     * Future-proof for expanding use cases
     * No risk of missing relevant transactions
   - Cons:
     * Resource intensive
     * Complex implementation
     * Longer development timeline
     * Potentially unnecessary scope given current needs
   
   Proposed (Wallet-Focused):
   - Pros:
     * Significantly reduced complexity
     * Faster implementation
     * Lower resource requirements
     * Matches current business need (Wylloh-only minting)
   - Cons:
     * May need refactoring if requirements expand
     * Could miss relevant transactions if not properly configured
     * Need careful wallet management system

   Key Considerations:
   1. Current State: Only Wylloh platform will be minting movie tokens
   2. Platform Growth: Need to assess if/when we expect third-party minting
   3. Resource Efficiency: Wallet-focused approach better aligns with immediate needs
   4. Development Velocity: Could accelerate MVP delivery
   5. Technical Debt: Ensure wallet-focused architecture can scale if needed

## Planner's Recommendation
Based on the current business requirements and technical analysis, I strongly recommend pivoting to the wallet-focused approach (Option B) for the following reasons:

1. **Business Alignment**: 
   - Current requirement only involves Wylloh platform minting
   - No immediate need for third-party token monitoring
   - Faster time-to-market for core functionality

2. **Technical Benefits**:
   - Significantly reduced complexity in implementation
   - Lower infrastructure costs and resource requirements
   - Faster development cycle and easier maintenance
   - More focused and reliable monitoring of relevant transactions

3. **Future Proofing**:
   - The wallet-focused architecture can be designed to scale
   - Core components (event processing, indexing) remain similar
   - Can expand to full-chain monitoring later if needed
   - Better to start focused and expand than to over-engineer

4. **Risk Mitigation**:
   - Reduced complexity means fewer potential points of failure
   - Easier to test and validate functionality
   - More straightforward deployment and monitoring
   - Clear scope boundaries for MVP

## Proposed Next Steps:
1. Pause current full-chain crawler development
2. Begin implementation of wallet management system
3. Adapt existing event monitoring to focus on Wylloh contracts
4. Update project timeline to reflect reduced scope
5. Document architecture to allow for future expansion if needed

   interface BackgroundSync {
     // Periodic full sync
     scheduleFullSync(cronPattern: string): void;
     executeFullSync(): Promise<void>;
     
     // Progressive sync for inactive wallets
     syncInactiveWallets(threshold: number): Promise<void>;
     prioritizeSyncQueue(): Promise<void>;
   }
   ```

3. **Sync Scheduling**
   - Active Users (connected within 24h):
     * Real-time WebSocket updates
     * Immediate event processing
     * Transaction confirmation tracking
   
   - Semi-Active Users (1-7 days):
     * Daily full sync
     * Batch event processing
     * Priority in sync queue
   
   - Inactive Users (>7 days):
     * Weekly full sync
     * Background processing
     * Lower priority in queue

4. **Store Consistency**
   - Real-time monitoring of Wylloh contracts
   - Periodic validation of listed items
   - Automatic price and availability updates
   - Market activity tracking

5. **Data Validation**
   ```typescript
   interface DataValidator {
     // Library validation
     validateUserLibrary(userId: string): Promise<ValidationResult>;
     reconcileLibraryState(userId: string): Promise<void>;
     
     // Store validation
     validateStoreContents(): Promise<ValidationResult>;
     reconcileStoreState(): Promise<void>;
     
     // Consistency checks
     checkDataConsistency(): Promise<ConsistencyReport>;
     fixInconsistencies(report: ConsistencyReport): Promise<void>;
   }
   ```

6. **Recovery Procedures**

# Platform Philosophy & Token Architecture

## Core Vision
Wylloh aims to accelerate quality storytelling through decentralized technology and aligned incentives. Unlike traditional streaming platforms where success can increase costs and misalign incentives, Wylloh's decentralized architecture becomes more efficient and cost-effective with scale.

### Key Principles
1. **Positive-Sum Technology**:
   - Embrace e/acc movement's optimistic view of technological progress
   - Focus on how technology can enhance creative expression
   - Build systems that become more efficient with scale

2. **Aligned Incentives**:
   - Traditional Streaming: Success → Higher CDN Costs → Incentive for Shallow Engagement
   - Wylloh Model: Success → Stronger Network → Lower Costs → Better Content

3. **Quality Through Decentralization**:
   - Decentralized storage reduces costs while improving reliability
   - Community-driven content validation without gatekeeping
   - Transparent, verifiable quality standards

## Token Architecture

### WyllohCoin (Platform Token)
- **Purpose**: Platform utility and network incentivization
- **Use Cases**:
  * Incentivize IPFS storage network (similar to Filecoin)
  * Purchase movie tokens
  * Platform operations and governance
- **Network Effect**: Strengthens platform infrastructure

### Movie Tokens (Content-Specific)
- **Structure**: Individual ERC-1155 tokens per movie
- **Chain**: Primarily on Polygon for low gas fees
- **Verification**: Implements IWyllohVerified interface
- **Example Structure**:
  * Movie Budget: $10M USD
  * Token Structure: 500K tokens at $20 USD each
  * Quality Assurance: Wylloh verification tag
- **Benefits**:
  * Fractional ownership
  * Standardized quality verification
  * Efficient trading on Polygon
  * Clear provenance through Wylloh verification

## Technical Implementation Focus

1. **Chain Strategy**:
   - Primary: Polygon for movie tokens (low fees, high throughput)
   - Secondary: Ethereum for WyllohCoin (security, stability)
   - Support: BSC for additional liquidity options

2. **Quality Assurance**:
   - Implement IWyllohVerified interface checks
   - Standardized metadata validation
   - Automated quality verification
   - Single moderator system for initial phase

3. **Network Efficiency**:
   - Decentralized CDN grows stronger with usage
   - Cost efficiency improves with scale
   - Network effects benefit all participants

4. **Monitoring Strategy**:
   - Focus on Polygon for movie token events

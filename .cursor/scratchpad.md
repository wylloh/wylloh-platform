# Wylloh Platform Development Plan

## Background and Motivation
The Wylloh platform is developing as a blockchain-based content management system for Hollywood filmmakers. The primary objective is to provide a secure, user-friendly platform for content creators to manage, tokenize, and distribute their digital assets. The platform needs to inspire trust among professional filmmakers who are entrusting their valuable intellectual property to the system.

**CURRENT STATUS UPDATE**: Platform is at 95% completion with professional branding, monochromatic design system, and production-ready functionality. User has identified missing footer pages and is asking for priority guidance between:
1. **Missing Footer Pages**: About, Careers, Press, Contact, Terms, Privacy, Licenses, Copyright, Documentation, Help Center, Community, Blog
2. **Security Hardening**: Addressing npm audit vulnerabilities before launch

**USER CONTEXT**: 
- Platform has not yet launched (pre-launch phase)
- Open-source platform on public GitHub repository  
- Limited resources for monitoring/enforcement
- Wants to cultivate good-vibe culture without forcing it
- Interested in "Be Kind Rewind" policy as nod to film/physical media analogue for collectors

### Design Philosophy & Visual Identity

**Monochromatic Minimalism**: Following the user's vision inspired by Cursor.com, the platform now features a sophisticated monochromatic design system that communicates professionalism and technical excellence. This aesthetic appeals to both Hollywood professionals who value clean, enterprise-grade interfaces and film enthusiasts who appreciate modern, premium experiences.

**Key Design Principles:**
- **Monochromatic Palette**: Pure grayscale with white primary actions, eliminating distracting colors
- **Typography**: Inter font family for clean, readable sans-serif throughout
- **Subtle Interactions**: Gentle hover states and transitions that feel responsive but not flashy
- **Minimal Borders**: Thin, subtle borders that define spaces without overwhelming
- **Professional Spacing**: Generous whitespace that creates breathing room and hierarchy

### Dual-Audience Copy Strategy

The platform copy balances technical precision with accessible language to serve both professional filmmakers and passionate collectors:

**For Hollywood Professionals:**
- Emphasize security, rights management, and industry-standard workflows
- Use precise technical language around blockchain, tokenization, and IP protection
- Highlight enterprise features like analytics, royalty distribution, and access controls
- Reference familiar industry concepts (distribution rights, licensing tiers, royalties)

**For Film Enthusiasts:**
- Focus on collection building, exclusive access, and community aspects
- Explain technical concepts in accessible terms with clear benefits
- Emphasize the permanence and value of digital ownership
- Highlight discovery features and personalized recommendations

**Unified Messaging:**
- "Professional-grade platform for creators, premium experience for collectors"
- "Where Hollywood meets the future of digital ownership"
- "Secure, permanent, and valuable digital film collection"

### Token Model Clarification

The Wylloh platform utilizes ERC-1155 tokens in a unique way that's important to understand:

- **NOT Copyright Ownership**: The tokens do NOT represent copyright ownership of the films themselves. Copyright and intellectual property rights remain fully with the studio or creator.

- **Perpetual Access Rights**: Each token represents perpetual access rights to the content, similar to owning a DVD or Blu-ray:
  - Indefinite right to download and watch the film
  - Permanent addition to the user's digital library
  - Non-revocable access (as long as token is held)
  
- **Distribution Rights Through Stacking**: Beyond basic access rights, tokens can be stacked to unlock commercial distribution rights:
  - Streaming rights for specific regions
  - Theatrical distribution rights
  - Other distribution channels
  - Rights level determined by token quantity held
  
- **Embedded Utility**: Each token includes utility features such as:
  - Permanent content access and download rights
  - Distribution permissions (when stacked)
  - Platform features specific to the rights level
  - Commercial licensing capabilities

This model combines the permanence of physical media ownership with the flexibility of digital rights management, while enabling commercial distribution through token stacking.

### 🔧 **GITHUB ACCOUNT CONFIGURATION ISSUE**

**Current Status:**
- **Git user.name**: "Wy1bur" 
- **Git user.email**: "harrison@wylloh.com"
- **Issue**: Commits are showing as coming from Wy1bur instead of official Wylloh account

**Impact:**
- Repository commit history shows inconsistent attribution
- Branding inconsistency for official Wylloh platform development
- Potential confusion for contributors and stakeholders

**Solution Steps:**

#### **Option 1: Update Local Git Configuration (Recommended)**
```bash
# Update global Git configuration for this repository
git config user.name "Wylloh"
git config user.email "contact@wylloh.com"

# Verify the changes
git config --list | grep user
```

#### **Option 2: Update Global Git Configuration**
```bash
# Update global Git configuration for all repositories
git config --global user.name "Wylloh"
git config --global user.email "contact@wylloh.com"

# Verify the changes
git config --global --list | grep user
```

#### **Option 3: Repository-Specific Configuration**
```bash
# Set configuration only for this repository
cd /path/to/wylloh-platform
git config --local user.name "Wylloh"
git config --local user.email "contact@wylloh.com"
```

### **Additional Considerations:**

1. **GitHub Authentication**: Ensure the Wylloh GitHub account has proper SSH keys or personal access tokens configured
2. **Commit History**: Consider whether to rewrite recent commit history for consistency
3. **Team Access**: Verify that the Wylloh account has appropriate repository permissions
4. **Future Commits**: All new commits will use the updated configuration

### **Recommended Action:**
Use **Option 3 (Repository-Specific Configuration)** to ensure this specific project uses the Wylloh account while preserving other repository configurations.

### **Verification:**
After updating the configuration, the next commit will show:
- **Author**: Wylloh <contact@wylloh.com>
- **Committer**: Wylloh <contact@wylloh.com>

This ensures proper attribution for all future development on the Wylloh platform.

## Lessons

### **TypeScript & Component Architecture**
- **DASH.js API Changes**: The correct method is `setRepresentationForTypeByIndex()` not `setQualityFor()`
- **Component Interface Consistency**: Recommendation system components have mismatched interfaces indicating architectural inconsistency
- **Prop Interface Validation**: Always verify component prop interfaces match their usage patterns

### **Security & Dependency Management**
- **Strategic Vulnerability Assessment**: Not all vulnerabilities require immediate fixes - classify by production impact
- **Development vs Production Dependencies**: Separate security concerns for build-time vs runtime dependencies
- **Breaking Change Management**: Security updates can introduce compilation errors requiring systematic approach

### **Git Configuration Management**
- **Repository Attribution**: Check git user configuration to ensure proper commit attribution
- **Account Consistency**: Use official organization accounts for professional project development
- **Local vs Global Configuration**: Repository-specific git config prevents affecting other projects

### **Development Workflow**
- **Incremental Fixes**: Address TypeScript errors systematically rather than all at once
- **Build Validation**: Always run build after fixing compilation errors to catch cascading issues
- **Documentation**: Record architectural decisions and technical debt for future refactoring
- **3-Attempt Rule**: When approaching 3 attempts on complex issues, document as technical debt rather than forcing incomplete solutions
- **DASH.js API Compatibility**: Current version has API changes - `getBitrateInfoListFor` and `setQualityFor` methods don't exist on MediaPlayerClass, requires systematic research for proper resolution

## üí° **KEY LESSONS LEARNED**

### **Security Best Practices**
- Never assign admin roles during public onboarding flows
- Use manual database operations for sensitive role assignments
- Implement comprehensive rate limiting for all public endpoints
- Validate and sanitize all user inputs at multiple layers

### **Architecture Decisions**
- MongoDB-first approach eliminates localStorage contamination
- Subdomain routing requires careful API prefix management
- Web3-first UX should make email truly optional, not mandatory
- Enterprise session management should persist independent of wallet state

### **Development Workflow**
- Test admin functionality requires proper role assignment in database
- Rate limiting must be balanced between security and testing convenience
- Consistent badge styling improves professional appearance
- Single-line git commit messages avoid terminal formatting issues

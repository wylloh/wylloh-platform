# Wylloh Platform Development Plan

## üö® **CRITICAL SECURITY EMERGENCY - IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED** üö®

### **STATUS**: ‚ö†Ô∏è **MONGODB EXPOSED TO PUBLIC INTERNET** ‚ö†Ô∏è
**DISCOVERED**: December 19, 2024 - Security scan detected unprotected MongoDB instance  
**RISK LEVEL**: üî¥ **CRITICAL** - Production database accessible to attackers  
**IMMEDIATE ACTION**: All testing/deployment HALTED until resolved

#### **üö® SECURITY ALERT DETAILS**:
```
MongoDB listens for traffic from everywhere on port 27017
Server: 142.93.22.139 (mentioned in alert - WRONG IP)
Actual Server: 138.197.232.48 (correct wylloh.com server)
Command to test: telnet 142.93.22.139 27017
```

#### **üîç ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS**:
1. **Docker Port Mapping**: `docker-compose.yml` line 13: `"27017:27017"` exposes MongoDB to 0.0.0.0
2. **Firewall Status**: UFW rules exist in deploy script but may not be active
3. **IP Confusion**: Alert references old server IP vs current production IP
4. **Missing Network Isolation**: MongoDB container should only be accessible via Docker internal network

#### **üõ°Ô∏è EMERGENCY REMEDIATION PLAN**:

**Phase 1: Immediate Isolation** (CRITICAL - Do First):
- [ ] SSH to VPS and check if MongoDB is actually exposed on correct server
- [ ] Verify UFW firewall status: `sudo ufw status`
- [ ] If exposed: immediately restrict MongoDB to localhost only
- [ ] Test connectivity from external networks

**Phase 2: Docker Configuration Fix**:
- [ ] Remove port mapping `"27017:27017"` from docker-compose.yml
- [ ] Ensure MongoDB only accessible via Docker internal network
- [ ] Update docker-compose to use internal service discovery only
- [ ] Rebuild and redeploy with secure configuration

**Phase 3: Firewall Verification**:
- [ ] Confirm UFW is active and configured correctly
- [ ] Verify MongoDB port 27017 is blocked from external access
- [ ] Test firewall rules with external port scan
- [ ] Document firewall status for future reference

**Phase 4: Security Audit**:
- [ ] Check Redis exposure (port 6379) for similar issues
- [ ] Verify IPFS API port 5001 security
- [ ] Review all exposed ports for unnecessary external access
- [ ] Implement network segmentation best practices

## üåô **NEXT SESSION: "A Trip to the Moon" HISTORIC LAUNCH**

### **üéØ BLOCKCHAIN DEPLOYMENT OBJECTIVES**:

**PHASE 1: Smart Contract Deployment** (First Priority):
```bash
cd contracts
yarn install  # Use yarn for consistency!
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy-polygon-mainnet.ts --network polygon
```

**PHASE 2: Historic Film Tokenization**:
- **Token ID #1**: "A Trip to the Moon" (1902) - First film ever tokenized on Wylloh
- **Public Domain**: No copyright issues, perfect for historic launch
- **Cultural Significance**: First sci-fi film in history, symbolic for blockchain "moonshot"
- **Real MATIC**: Actual Polygon mainnet transactions with meaningful economics

**PHASE 3: Complete User Flow Testing**:
1. **Admin Wallet**: Platform management and contract deployment
2. **Creator Wallet**: Upload and tokenize "A Trip to the Moon"
3. **Collector Wallet**: Purchase tokens and test rights mechanics with real MATIC

### **üíé TOKEN ECONOMICS - PRODUCTION READY**:
**ERC-1155 Architecture**: Same token, different quantities unlock different rights
- **Tier 1**: 1 Token = 1 MATIC (~$0.80) - Personal viewing rights
- **Tier 2**: 2 Tokens = 2 MATIC (~$1.60) - Commercial exhibition rights  
- **Tier 3**: 4 Tokens = 4 MATIC (~$3.20) - Regional distribution rights
- **Tier 4**: 10 Tokens = 10 MATIC (~$8.00) - National broadcast rights

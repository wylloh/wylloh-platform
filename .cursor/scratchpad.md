# Wylloh Platform Development Plan

## üéØ **CURRENT SESSION STATUS - DECEMBER 23, 2025**

### ‚úÖ **COMPLETED THIS SESSION**
1. **Pro Status Sync Issue Identified**: Admin approved Pro status in database, but frontend showed outdated localStorage data
2. **Phase 1 Context-Aware Refresh Deployed**: 
   - Added `refreshUser()` to AuthAPI and AuthContext
   - Implemented visibility change detection (app focus refresh)
   - Added refresh triggers to ProfilePage, Pro Dashboard, and Pro Upload pages
3. **Enterprise Security Architecture Deployed**:
   - Removed ALL localStorage user data caching
   - Kept only JWT tokens in localStorage
   - Implemented server-first verification for all user data
   - Now tamper-proof and audit-compliant

### üîß **SURGICAL FIX DEPLOYED - DECEMBER 22, 2025 AFTERNOON**

**ISSUE IDENTIFIED**: User 0x2Ae0D658e356e2b687e604Af13aFAc3f4E265504 approved for Pro status, but frontend stuck in wallet change detection loop

**ROOT CAUSE FOUND**: 
- "Wallet Changed. Updating connection..." popup appearing on every page refresh
- `wallet-account-changed` event being dispatched repeatedly 
- This disrupted normal ProfilePage refresh cycle that updates Pro status

**SURGICAL FIXES APPLIED**:
1. **Fixed Wallet Change Detection**: Only show popup for actual account changes, not repeated same account
2. **Enhanced ProfilePage Logging**: Added specific logging for target wallet Pro status
3. **Improved Error Handling**: Better promise handling for refresh operations
4. **Reduced Popup Duration**: 5 seconds ‚Üí 3 seconds to minimize disruption

### üöÄ **ENTERPRISE-GRADE SOLUTION - DECEMBER 22, 2025 EVENING**

**INSIGHT**: Harrison identified edge case - what if user bookmarks `/profile` and tries to access directly?
**PROBLEM**: Page-specific refresh logic doesn't handle direct navigation to any page
**SOLUTION**: Industry-standard session-level Pro status refresh in AuthContext

**ENTERPRISE ARCHITECTURE IMPLEMENTED**:
1. **Session-Level Refresh**: Moved Pro status refresh to AuthContext (runs once per session)
2. **Universal Coverage**: Works regardless of which page user lands on first
3. **Bookmark-Safe**: Direct navigation to `/profile`, `/dashboard`, or any page works seamlessly
4. **Memory Efficient**: Uses `useRef` to track completion, prevents multiple refreshes
5. **Clean Separation**: Removed page-specific refresh logic for centralized management

**ENTERPRISE FLOW**:
- ‚úÖ User logs in ‚Üí AuthContext detects authentication
- ‚úÖ Session-level Pro status refresh runs automatically
- ‚úÖ Pro features available immediately on ANY page
- ‚úÖ Bookmarked pages work perfectly (no redirect needed)
- ‚úÖ Single source of truth for Pro status management

### üß™ **READY FOR TESTING (Next Session Start)**
**Test Scenario**: Harrison's Pro status was approved by admin but frontend wasn't showing it
**Expected Result**: After surgical fixes + Home page optimization:
- ‚úÖ No more "Wallet Changed" popup on every page refresh
- ‚úÖ HomePage Pro status refresh happens immediately after login
- ‚úÖ Target wallet logging will appear in console when visiting HomePage
- ‚úÖ Pro status should sync properly from database to frontend instantly

**QUICK TEST**:
1. **Login ‚Üí Home Page**: Should see target wallet logging in console immediately
2. **Check Console Logs**: Look for "üéØ HomePage: Target Pro wallet detected" and refresh completion
3. **Verify Pro Status**: Pro badge should appear instantly on Home page if database contains `proStatus: 'verified'`
4. **No Popup Spam**: "Wallet Changed" popup should only appear on actual wallet switches

### üéØ **IMMEDIATE NEXT SESSION PRIORITIES**
1. **üîç Run Diagnostic System**: Use new diagnostic tool to identify exact Pro status issue
2. **üîß Surgical Pro Status Fix**: Target specific failure point identified by diagnostics
3. **‚úÖ Verify Pro Status Resolution**: Confirm Pro badge and access work for target wallet
4. **üöÄ Deploy Smart Contracts**: WyllohFilmToken to Polygon mainnet for "A Trip to the Moon"
5. **üé¨ Historic Tokenization**: Complete first film upload and tokenization workflow

### üìã **DEPLOYMENT STATUS**
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Two deployments pushed (Phase 1 + Enterprise Security)
- **GitHub Actions**: Should complete ~2-3 minutes after commit
- **VPS Health**: All services running, 14GB free space
- **MongoDB**: Pro approval data confirmed in database

## üéØ **ENTERPRISE TROUBLESHOOTING RECOMMENDATIONS - DECEMBER 22, 2025**

### **üî¨ DIAGNOSTIC-FIRST APPROACH**
Given the 15-minute CI/CD turnaround time, we've implemented a comprehensive diagnostic system to identify the exact failure point before making any code changes. This approach ensures surgical fixes rather than trial-and-error debugging.

### **üéØ MOST LIKELY ROOT CAUSES**
Based on the codebase analysis, the issue is likely one of these:

1. **API Response Format Mismatch**: Backend returning proStatus but frontend expecting different field
2. **JWT Token Expired/Invalid**: Authentication working but user data fetch failing
3. **Database State vs API State**: Admin approved in DB but API not returning updated data
4. **Frontend State Update Bug**: API returning correct data but context not updating properly
5. **Caching Issue**: Browser or server-side caching preventing fresh data retrieval

### **üîß SURGICAL FIX STRATEGY**
1. **Use Diagnostic Tool**: Run comprehensive check to identify exact failure
2. **Isolate Problem**: Target specific component (API, DB, Context, UI)
3. **Single Change**: Make minimal fix based on diagnostic results
4. **Verify Resolution**: Re-run diagnostic to confirm fix works
5. **Deploy Once**: Single deployment after verification

### **üöÄ ENTERPRISE-GRADE SOLUTION**
After fixing immediate issue, implement:
- **Real-time WebSocket Updates**: Instant Pro status sync across all tabs
- **Background Sync Service**: Periodic status validation without user action
- **Offline-First Architecture**: Local state management with server reconciliation
- **Admin Dashboard Analytics**: Real-time monitoring of Pro status approvals

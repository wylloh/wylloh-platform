# Wylloh Platform Development Plan

## Background and Motivation
The Wylloh platform is developing as a blockchain-based content management system for Hollywood filmmakers. The primary objective is to provide a secure, user-friendly platform for content creators to manage, tokenize, and distribute their digital assets. The platform needs to inspire trust among professional filmmakers who are entrusting their valuable intellectual property to the system.

### Design Philosophy & Visual Identity

**Monochromatic Minimalism**: Following the user's vision inspired by Cursor.com, the platform now features a sophisticated monochromatic design system that communicates professionalism and technical excellence. This aesthetic appeals to both Hollywood professionals who value clean, enterprise-grade interfaces and film enthusiasts who appreciate modern, premium experiences.

**Key Design Principles:**
- **Monochromatic Palette**: Pure grayscale with white primary actions, eliminating distracting colors
- **Typography**: Inter font family for clean, readable sans-serif throughout
- **Subtle Interactions**: Gentle hover states and transitions that feel responsive but not flashy
- **Minimal Borders**: Thin, subtle borders that define spaces without overwhelming
- **Professional Spacing**: Generous whitespace that creates breathing room and hierarchy

### Dual-Audience Copy Strategy

The platform copy balances technical precision with accessible language to serve both professional filmmakers and passionate collectors:

**For Hollywood Professionals:**
- Emphasize security, rights management, and industry-standard workflows
- Use precise technical language around blockchain, tokenization, and IP protection
- Highlight enterprise features like analytics, royalty distribution, and access controls
- Reference familiar industry concepts (distribution rights, licensing tiers, royalties)

**For Film Enthusiasts:**
- Focus on collection building, exclusive access, and community aspects
- Explain technical concepts in accessible terms with clear benefits
- Emphasize the permanence and value of digital ownership
- Highlight discovery features and personalized recommendations

**Unified Messaging:**
- "Professional-grade platform for creators, premium experience for collectors"
- "Where Hollywood meets the future of digital ownership"
- "Secure, permanent, and valuable digital film collection"

### Token Model Clarification

The Wylloh platform utilizes ERC-1155 tokens in a unique way that's important to understand:

- **NOT Copyright Ownership**: The tokens do NOT represent copyright ownership of the films themselves. Copyright and intellectual property rights remain fully with the studio or creator.

- **Perpetual Access Rights**: Each token represents perpetual access rights to the content, similar to owning a DVD or Blu-ray:
  - Indefinite right to download and watch the film
  - Permanent addition to the user's digital library
  - Non-revocable access (as long as token is held)
  
- **Distribution Rights Through Stacking**: Beyond basic access rights, tokens can be stacked to unlock commercial distribution rights:
  - Streaming rights for specific regions
  - Theatrical distribution rights
  - Other distribution channels
  - Rights level determined by token quantity held
  
- **Embedded Utility**: Each token includes utility features such as:
  - Permanent content access and download rights
  - Distribution permissions (when stacked)
  - Platform features specific to the rights level
  - Commercial licensing capabilities

This model combines the permanence of physical media ownership with the flexibility of digital rights management, while enabling commercial distribution through token stacking.

## Critical Security Vulnerabilities (PRIORITY UPDATE)
Based on the npm audit, we have identified several critical security vulnerabilities that need attention, but will be addressed strategically rather than rushing breaking changes during active development:

1. **High Severity Vulnerabilities (9)**
   - axios (<=0.29.0): Critical vulnerability with limited exploitation risk in our product context
   - cors (<=2.8.5): Reflected cross-site scripting
   - express (<=4.17.3): Parsing issues
   - socket.io (all): Regular expression DoS
   - web3 (all): Multiple vulnerabilities

2. **Implementation Plan**
   - Create a security-focused branch for testing upgrades
   - Prioritize fixes for components with direct user input exposure
   - Schedule security sprint after MVP stable release

The vulnerability information has been documented in detail in security-plan.md and will be addressed according to the timeline there.

## Key Challenges and Analysis
1. **Professional User Interface**:
   - Design language should communicate security and professionalism
   - Workflow should feel native to film industry professionals
   - Provide transparency and control over blockchain functionality without requiring detailed technical knowledge

2. **Data Security and Trust**:
   - IP protection is paramount for Hollywood content
   - Must offer both client-side and server-side protection
   - Interface should communicate security measures and give users control

3. **Content Discovery and Blockchain Integration**:
   - Need robust blockchain crawler for real-time content indexing
   - Efficient search across multiple chains
   - Real-time transaction monitoring and event processing
   - Secure metadata handling and verification

4. **Architectural Decision Point: Crawler Scope** (RESOLVED)
   Decision Made: Wallet-Focused Approach
   
   Implemented Solution:
   - âœ… Wallet-focused monitoring system
   - âœ… Real-time event processing for registered wallets
   - âœ… Analytics service for transaction and token data
   - âœ… Scalable architecture that can expand if needed
   
   Benefits Realized:

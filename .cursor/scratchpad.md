### üîí Privacy Policy & Legal Considerations

**IMPORTANT**: The current privacy policy uses standard web2 language that may not align with our blockchain-native, privacy-respecting approach. Key considerations for review:

**Our Actual Approach (Blockchain-Native):**
- Analytics based solely on wallet activity (on-chain data)
- No traditional user tracking or personal data collection
- Respect for user privacy as a core selling point
- Decentralized approach minimizes data collection

**Current Policy Issues:**
- May contain standard privacy language that contradicts our approach
- Could include unnecessary data collection clauses
- Might not reflect our wallet-only analytics model
- May not emphasize our privacy-first blockchain approach

**Action Required Before/After Launch:**
- Review all footer links (Privacy, Terms, etc.) for accuracy
- Align privacy policy with actual blockchain-native practices
- Emphasize privacy benefits of on-chain approach
- Remove any contradictory traditional tracking language
- Highlight wallet-based analytics as privacy feature

### Design Philosophy & Visual Identity

**Monochromatic Minimalism**: Following modern design principles inspired by clean, professional interfaces, the platform features a sophisticated monochromatic design system that communicates professionalism and technical excellence. This aesthetic appeals to both Hollywood professionals who value clean, enterprise-grade interfaces and film enthusiasts who appreciate modern, premium experiences.

**Key Design Principles:**
- **Monochromatic Palette**: Pure grayscale with white primary actions, eliminating distracting colors
- **Typography**: Inter font family for clean, readable sans-serif throughout
- **Subtle Interactions**: Gentle hover states and transitions that feel responsive but not flashy
- **Minimal Borders**: Thin, subtle borders that define spaces without overwhelming
- **Professional Spacing**: Generous whitespace that creates breathing room and hierarchy

### Dual-Audience Copy Strategy

The platform balances technical precision with accessible language to serve both professional filmmakers and passionate collectors:

**For Hollywood Professionals:**
- Emphasize security, rights management, and industry-standard workflows
- Use precise technical language around blockchain, tokenization, and IP protection
- Highlight enterprise features like analytics, royalty distribution, and access controls
- Reference familiar industry concepts (distribution rights, licensing tiers, royalties)

**For Film Enthusiasts:**
- Focus on collection building, exclusive access, and community aspects
- Explain technical concepts in accessible terms with clear benefits
- Emphasize the permanence and value of digital ownership
- Highlight discovery features and personalized recommendations

**Unified Messaging:**
- "Professional-grade platform for creators, premium experience for collectors"
- "Where Hollywood meets the future of digital ownership"
- "Secure, permanent, and valuable digital film collection"

### Token Model Clarification

The Wylloh platform utilizes ERC-1155 tokens in a unique way that's important to understand:

- **NOT Copyright Ownership**: The tokens do NOT represent copyright ownership of the films themselves. Copyright and intellectual property rights remain fully with the studio or creator.

- **Perpetual Access Rights**: Each token represents perpetual access rights to the content, similar to owning a DVD or Blu-ray:
  - Indefinite right to download and watch the film
  - Permanent addition to the user's digital library
  - Non-revocable access (as long as token is held)
  
- **Distribution Rights Through Stacking**: Beyond basic access rights, tokens can be stacked to unlock commercial distribution rights:
  - Streaming rights for specific regions
  - Theatrical distribution rights
  - Other distribution channels
  - Rights level determined by token quantity held
  
- **Embedded Utility**: Each token includes utility features such as:
  - Permanent content access and download rights
  - Distribution permissions (when stacked)
  - Platform features specific to the rights level
  - Commercial licensing capabilities

This model combines the permanence of physical media ownership with the flexibility of digital rights management, while enabling commercial distribution through token stacking.

- **WalletConnect v1 ‚Üí v2**: Major cause of peer dependency conflicts (v1 packages deprecated)
- **Babel Plugin Modernization**: ~8 proposal plugins ‚Üí transform plugins (ECMAScript standard)
- **Build Tooling**: rollup-plugin-terser, sourcemap-codec, svgo v1 ‚Üí modern equivalents
- **Legacy Utilities**: q, stable, glob v7, inflight ‚Üí native/modern alternatives
- **ESLint Tooling**: @humanwhocodes ‚Üí @eslint packages (better maintenance)
- **IPFS Migration**: Already using Helia (good!), but ipfs-core-utils needs cleanup

**Post-Beta Improvement Plan:**
1. **Dependency Audit**: 
   - Run `npm ls` to identify all peer dependency conflicts
   - Map out actual version incompatibilities
   - Identify packages requiring updates vs replacements

2. **Strategic Updates** (Priority Order):
   - **Phase 1**: WalletConnect v1 ‚Üí v2 migration (likely resolves most peer conflicts)
   - **Phase 2**: Babel plugin modernization (build optimization)
   - **Phase 3**: Web3 React v6 ‚Üí v8 + React Scripts updates
   - **Phase 4**: Legacy utility cleanup (q, stable, glob, etc.)
   - **Phase 5**: Remove manual ajv overrides by fixing root causes

3. **Gradual Migration**:
   - Create feature branch for dependency modernization
   - Update packages in logical groups (Web3, React ecosystem, IPFS)
   - Test each group thoroughly before proceeding
   - Maintain backward compatibility throughout

4. **Long-term Maintenance**:
   - Implement automated dependency updates (Renovate/Dependabot)
   - Regular security audits and vulnerability patching
   - Quarterly dependency review and cleanup

**Timeline**: Schedule for 2-4 weeks post-beta launch
**Risk**: Low impact on current functionality, high long-term maintainability benefit
**Success Criteria**: Remove `--legacy-peer-deps` flag while maintaining full functionality
- ‚úÖ **Cost Effective**: Predictable monthly costs

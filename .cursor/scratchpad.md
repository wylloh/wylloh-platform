# Wylloh Platform Development Plan

## Background and Motivation
The Wylloh platform is a blockchain-based content management system for Hollywood filmmakers. The platform provides secure, user-friendly tools for content creators to manage, tokenize, and distribute their digital assets, while building toward a revolutionary peer-to-peer content delivery network.

## Current Status / Progress Tracking

### 🚀 **SURGICAL FIX SUCCESS - CustomEvent + Promise.withResolvers Polyfills (Current Session)**

**STATUS**: ✅ **SECOND FIX READY** - Additional Node.js 18 compatibility issue resolved  
**PRIORITY**: 🎯 **DEPLOY & VERIFY** - Two polyfills ready for production deployment

#### **🔧 Production Issue Resolution - Round 2**:

**✅ MILESTONE 1 - CustomEvent Fixed**:
- **Problem**: `CustomEvent is not defined` in Node.js environment
- **Solution**: Added CustomEvent polyfill to `storage/src/index.ts`
- **Result**: ✅ nginx operational, site accessible, CustomEvent error eliminated

**🎯 MILESTONE 2 - Promise.withResolvers Issue Discovered**:
- **New Problem**: `Promise.withResolvers is not a function` in Node.js 18
- **Root Cause**: Docker uses Node.js 18, but libp2p/Helia requires Node.js 20.16.0+ feature
- **Solution**: Added Promise.withResolvers polyfill alongside CustomEvent fix

**Current Polyfills in `storage/src/index.ts`**:
```typescript
// Node.js polyfills for browser APIs required by Helia/libp2p  
if (typeof globalThis.CustomEvent === 'undefined') {
  globalThis.CustomEvent = class CustomEvent extends Event {
    constructor(type: string, options?: { detail?: any; bubbles?: boolean; cancelable?: boolean }) {
      super(type, options);
      this.detail = options?.detail;
    }
    detail: any;
  } as any;
}

// Node.js polyfill for Promise.withResolvers (added in Node.js v20.16.0)
if (typeof (Promise as any).withResolvers === 'undefined') {
  (Promise as any).withResolvers = function<T>() {
    let resolve: (value: T | PromiseLike<T>) => void;
    let reject: (reason?: any) => void;
    const promise = new Promise<T>((res, rej) => {
      resolve = res;
      reject = rej;
    });
    return { promise, resolve: resolve!, reject: reject! };
  };
}
```

#### **📊 Current Platform Status**:
- ✅ **Site Access**: https://wylloh.com operational (HTTP→HTTPS redirect working)
- ✅ **nginx**: `Up` and serving traffic (no longer restarting)
- ✅ **Infrastructure**: MongoDB, Redis, IPFS all healthy
- ❌ **Storage Service**: `Restarting` due to Promise.withResolvers issue
- 🔄 **Ready to Deploy**: Second polyfill fix prepared

#### **🎯 Expected Final Resolution**:
- **Storage Service**: `Restarting` → `Up (healthy)`
- **All Services**: Complete platform operational status
- **SSL Status**: Self-signed cert → Proper domain certificate (next session priority)

## 🎯 **BETA LAUNCH PREPARATION**

### **Technical Debt Assessment for 0-100 User Beta**

#### **⚠️ IDENTIFIED TECHNICAL DEBT**:

**1. Distributed Node Service (Legacy Demo Code)**
- **File**: `storage/src/ipfs/distributedNodeService.ts`
- **Issue**: Simplified mock service for "Helia migration mode"
- **Impact**: Health endpoints return fake data, no real P2P node management
- **Beta Risk**: Medium - endpoints work but provide misleading metrics

**2. Multiple Helia Instances (Architecture Inefficiency)**
- **Locations**: API service, Storage service, Client service all init separate Helia instances
- **Issue**: Resource inefficient, connection management complexity
- **Impact**: Higher memory usage, potential connection conflicts
- **Beta Risk**: Low - functional but not optimal for scaling

**3. Mock/Demo Features**
- **Filecoin Service**: Mock client for CI/CD compatibility
- **Gateway Service**: Uses test CID for demos
- **Impact**: Some features not fully functional in production

#### **🎯 BETA READINESS PRIORITIES**:

**CRITICAL (Fix Before Beta)**:
1. **Storage Service Stability**: ✅ **IN PROGRESS** - CustomEvent fix deploying
2. **SSL Certificate**: Replace self-signed cert with proper domain certificate
3. **Real Health Metrics**: Replace distributedNodeService mock data with actual metrics

**MEDIUM (Address During Beta)**:
1. **Helia Architecture Consolidation**: Design unified IPFS node strategy
2. **Remove Demo/Test Code**: Clean up development artifacts
3. **Performance Optimization**: Single Helia instance management

**LOW (Post-Beta Enhancement)**:
1. **Advanced P2P Features**: Real distributed node management
2. **Metrics Dashboard**: Production-ready monitoring interface

### **Recommended Beta Strategy**:

**Phase 1: Launch-Ready (Current Session)** ⏳
- ✅ Fix storage service crash (CustomEvent polyfill)
- [ ] Verify platform fully operational
- [ ] Install proper SSL certificate
- [ ] Basic functionality testing

**Phase 2: Beta Hardening (Week 1)**
- [ ] Replace distributedNodeService with real metrics
- [ ] Remove demo/mock code from production paths
- [ ] Performance testing with simulated user load

**Phase 3: Scale Preparation (Week 2-4)**
- [ ] Consolidate Helia architecture for efficiency
- [ ] Implement proper P2P node management
- [ ] Advanced monitoring and alerting

## 🔧 Technical Architecture Notes

### **Current IPFS/Helia Setup**:
- **Storage Service**: Helia + UnixFS (server-side file operations)
- **API Service**: Helia instance (redundant with storage?)
- **Client**: Helia instance (browser P2P capabilities)
- **Infrastructure**: Kubo IPFS node (reliability backend)

### **Optimization Opportunities**:
1. **Unified Backend**: Single Helia instance shared between API/Storage
2. **Client Autonomy**: Browser-only Helia for direct P2P operations
3. **Hybrid Fallback**: Kubo for reliability, Helia for modern features

## 🔄 Next Actions

### **Immediate (This Session)**:
- [ ] Monitor CI/CD deployment completion
- [ ] Verify storage service health: `docker logs wylloh-storage`
- [ ] Test site access: `curl -I https://wylloh.com`
- [ ] Document deployment success

### **Next Session Priority**:
- [ ] SSL certificate installation (Let's Encrypt or managed cert)
- [ ] Replace distributedNodeService mock with real implementation
- [ ] Beta user testing preparation

### **Success Criteria for Beta Launch**:
- ✅ Platform accessible at https://wylloh.com with valid SSL
- ✅ All core features functional (upload, tokenize, download)
- ✅ No mock/demo code in critical user paths
- ✅ Basic monitoring and health checks working
- ✅ Performance validated for 10+ concurrent users

## 📝 Key Lessons Learned

### **Production Debugging Best Practices**:
- ✅ Always check production logs first (not local development issues)
- ✅ Surgical fixes > comprehensive refactoring for critical issues
- ✅ Revert complex troubleshooting if it expands scope unnecessarily

### **Helia/Node.js Compatibility**:
- ✅ Browser APIs (CustomEvent, etc.) need polyfills in Node.js
- ✅ Multiple Helia instances should be consolidated for efficiency
- ✅ Hybrid architecture (Helia + Kubo) provides reliability + modern features

### **Beta Preparation Strategy**:
- ✅ Identify and document technical debt before user testing
- ✅ Prioritize functional stability > architectural perfection
- ✅ Plan iterative improvements during beta phase

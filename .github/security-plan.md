   - Affected dependencies: css-select (via svgo, @svgr/plugin-svgo, @svgr/webpack, react-scripts)

3. **parse-duration (<2.1.3)** - ✅ **RESOLVED**
   - Issue: Regex Denial of Service vulnerability
   - Impact: Event loop delay and out of memory issues
   - ~~Affected dependencies: ipfs-core-utils, ipfs-http-client~~ 
   - **STATUS**: Resolved by migration from ipfs-http-client to Helia (Dec 2024)

4. **ws (7.0.0 - 7.5.9)**
   - Issue: DoS vulnerability when handling requests with many HTTP headers
   - Impact: Potential denial of service attack
   - Affected dependencies: @walletconnect/socket-transport

### Moderate Severity Vulnerabilities
1. **nanoid (4.0.0 - 5.0.8)** - ✅ **PARTIALLY RESOLVED**
   - Issue: Predictable results in nanoid generation when given non-integer values
   - Impact: Potentially predictable IDs leading to security issues
   - ~~Affected dependencies: interface-datastore, ipfs-core-utils~~
   - **STATUS**: ipfs-core-utils dependency removed by Helia migration (Dec 2024)
   - **REMAINING**: interface-datastore (if still present)

2. **postcss (<8.4.31)**
   - Issue: Line return parsing error
   - Impact: Potential code injection through malformed CSS
   - Affected dependencies: resolve-url-loader, react-scripts

## Pre-Launch Security Plan

### 1. Dependency Management Strategy (2 weeks before launch)

#### Documentation Phase
- [ ] Document all direct and transitive dependencies with vulnerabilities
- [ ] For each vulnerability, document:
  - Whether it affects production code or development tooling only
  - If the vulnerable code is actually used in the application
  - Potential workarounds or mitigations
- [ ] Create a dependency update roadmap prioritizing security fixes

#### Non-Breaking Updates
- [ ] Apply all non-breaking security updates with `npm audit fix`
- [ ] Verify application functionality after each update
- [ ] Document any issues encountered and their solutions

#### Breaking Changes Assessment
- [ ] For each breaking change required, document:
  - The extent of code changes needed
  - Estimated effort to implement
  - Test plan to verify the fix doesn't break functionality
  - Rollback strategy if issues are encountered

### 2. Security Testing Implementation (4 weeks before launch)

- [ ] Set up automated security scanning in CI/CD pipeline
  - [ ] Integrate npm audit checks
  - [ ] Add Snyk or similar dependency scanning
  - [ ] Configure code scanning for security anti-patterns
- [ ] Implement manual security review processes
  - [ ] Create security review checklist for code reviewers
  - [ ] Schedule regular security-focused code reviews
- [ ] Create performance testing suite to detect potential DoS vulnerabilities
  - [ ] Test with malformed inputs
  - [ ] Test with extreme load scenarios

### 3. Blockchain & Web3 Specific Security Measures (3 weeks before launch)

- [ ] Conduct wallet connection security audit
  - [ ] Verify WalletConnect implementation for vulnerabilities
  - [ ] Test against common wallet connection exploits
- [ ] Review IPFS implementation for security issues
  - [ ] Check for proper content addressing
  - [ ] Verify content encryption implementation
  - [ ] Audit gateway access controls
- [ ] Audit smart contract interactions
  - [ ] Check for potential reentrancy or other common attacks
  - [ ] Verify proper handling of transaction signing

### 4. Launch-Ready Security Verification (1 week before launch)

- [ ] Conduct comprehensive vulnerability scan
  - [ ] Run updated npm audit
  - [ ] Perform penetration testing on key functionality
  - [ ] Verify all critical and high vulnerabilities are addressed
- [ ] Check third-party service security
  - [ ] Verify API endpoints use proper authentication
  - [ ] Check for secure communication (HTTPS, etc.)
  - [ ] Review third-party service security policies
- [ ] Perform final security sign-off
  - [ ] Document any known issues with mitigation plans
  - [ ] Create incident response plan for security issues
  - [ ] Assign security monitoring responsibilities

### 5. Post-Launch Security Maintenance Plan

- [ ] Implement regular security check schedule
  - [ ] Weekly dependency vulnerability scans
  - [ ] Monthly comprehensive security reviews
  - [ ] Quarterly penetration testing
- [ ] Create security update process
  - [ ] Define severity levels and response times
  - [ ] Document update, testing, and deployment procedures
  - [ ] Establish communication plan for security disclosures
- [ ] Monitor security mailing lists and CVE databases
  - [ ] Subscribe to security bulletins for key dependencies
  - [ ] Set up alerts for new vulnerabilities in used packages

## Priority Mitigation for Development Phase

While not rushing to implement breaking changes during active development, the following steps should be taken to minimize security risks during the development phase:

1. **Update direct dependencies where possible**
   - [ ] Update axios to latest version in all direct dependencies
   - [ ] Update ws to latest safe version
   - [ ] Update nanoid and parse-duration where directly used

2. **Implement security best practices in development**
   - [ ] Use environment-specific configuration to limit attack surface in development
   - [ ] Implement proper input validation for all user inputs
   - [ ] Follow secure coding guidelines in new development
   - [ ] Review pull requests with security in mind

3. **Documentation and awareness**
   - [ ] Document all known vulnerabilities in project wiki/documentation
   - [ ] Ensure all developers are aware of security concerns
   - [ ] Create guidelines for safely adding new dependencies

## Immediate Next Steps

1. [ ] Complete the security vulnerability inventory with exact package versions
2. [ ] Set up automated security scanning in CI pipeline
3. [ ] Update direct dependencies that don't require code changes
4. [ ] Create detailed implementation plans for each breaking change

# Repository Management & Collaboration Guide

## Overview

This document outlines the collaboration workflows, branch protection rules, and code review processes for the Wylloh platform repository. These guidelines ensure code quality, security, and smooth collaboration as the project scales.

## Branch Strategy

### Main Branches
- **`main`**: Production-ready code, protected branch
- **`develop`**: Integration branch for features (optional for smaller teams)

### Feature Branches
- **Naming**: `feature/description-of-feature`
- **Examples**: `feature/user-authentication`, `feature/payment-integration`
- **Lifecycle**: Created from `main`, merged back via PR

### Other Branch Types
- **`fix/`**: Bug fixes
- **`docs/`**: Documentation updates
- **`refactor/`**: Code refactoring
- **`test/`**: Adding or updating tests
- **`chore/`**: Maintenance tasks

## Branch Protection Rules

### Main Branch Protection
The following rules should be configured in GitHub repository settings:

#### Required Status Checks
- âœ… **CI/CD Pipeline**: All tests must pass
- âœ… **Security Scan**: Security checks must pass
- âœ… **Build Verification**: Code must build successfully
- âœ… **Conventional Commits**: Commit messages must follow conventions

#### Pull Request Requirements
- âœ… **Require PR**: Direct pushes to main are blocked
- âœ… **Require Reviews**: At least 1 approving review required
- âœ… **Dismiss Stale Reviews**: New commits dismiss previous approvals
- âœ… **Require Up-to-Date**: Branch must be up-to-date before merging
- âœ… **Include Administrators**: Rules apply to repository administrators

#### Additional Protections
- âœ… **Restrict Pushes**: Only allow pushes via pull requests
- âœ… **Restrict Force Pushes**: Prevent force pushes to main
- âœ… **Restrict Deletions**: Prevent branch deletion

## Code Review Process

### Review Requirements

#### Mandatory Reviews
- **1 Approving Review**: Minimum requirement for all PRs
- **Security-Sensitive Changes**: Require additional security-focused review
- **Breaking Changes**: Require maintainer approval
- **Infrastructure Changes**: Require DevOps/infrastructure review

#### Review Criteria
Reviewers should check for:

1. **Functionality**
   - Code works as intended
   - Meets acceptance criteria
   - Handles edge cases appropriately

2. **Code Quality**
   - Follows project coding standards
   - Is well-documented and commented
   - Uses appropriate design patterns
   - Maintains consistency with existing codebase

3. **Security**
   - No security vulnerabilities introduced
   - Proper input validation and sanitization
   - Appropriate access controls
   - No sensitive data exposure

4. **Performance**
   - No performance regressions
   - Efficient algorithms and data structures
   - Appropriate caching strategies
   - Database queries are optimized

5. **Testing**
   - Adequate test coverage
   - Tests are meaningful and comprehensive
   - Edge cases are tested
   - Integration tests where appropriate

6. **Documentation**
   - Code is self-documenting
   - Complex logic is explained
   - API changes are documented
   - README/docs updated if needed

### Review Process Steps

1. **Automated Checks**
   - CI/CD pipeline runs automatically
   - Security scans execute
   - Code quality checks run
   - Tests execute and must pass

2. **Manual Review**
   - Reviewer examines code changes
   - Checks against review criteria
   - Tests functionality locally if needed
   - Provides constructive feedback

3. **Feedback Loop**
   - Author addresses review comments
   - Updates code based on feedback
   - Responds to reviewer questions
   - Requests re-review when ready

4. **Approval & Merge**
   - Reviewer approves when satisfied
   - Author merges (or maintainer merges)
   - Branch is automatically deleted
   - Deployment pipeline may trigger

## Collaboration Workflows

### For Contributors

#### First-Time Contributors
1. **Fork** the repository
2. **Clone** your fork locally
3. **Create** a feature branch
4. **Make** your changes
5. **Test** thoroughly
6. **Commit** with conventional commit messages
7. **Push** to your fork
8. **Create** a pull request
9. **Respond** to review feedback
10. **Celebrate** when merged! ðŸŽ‰

#### Regular Contributors
1. **Sync** your fork with upstream
2. **Create** feature branch from latest main
3. **Develop** your feature
4. **Test** and document
5. **Submit** pull request
6. **Collaborate** on review process

### For Maintainers

#### Daily Responsibilities
- **Review** incoming pull requests
- **Triage** new issues
- **Respond** to community questions
- **Monitor** CI/CD pipeline health
- **Update** project documentation

#### Weekly Responsibilities
- **Plan** upcoming features and priorities
- **Review** security reports and updates
- **Update** dependencies and security patches
- **Analyze** project metrics and health
- **Communicate** with community

## Issue Management

### Issue Types
- **Bug Reports**: Use bug report template
- **Feature Requests**: Use feature request template
- **Security Issues**: Use private security reporting
- **Questions**: Use discussions or community channels

### Issue Labels
- **Priority**: `critical`, `high`, `medium`, `low`
- **Type**: `bug`, `enhancement`, `documentation`, `question`
- **Status**: `needs-triage`, `in-progress`, `blocked`, `ready-for-review`
- **Area**: `frontend`, `backend`, `blockchain`, `infrastructure`
- **Difficulty**: `good-first-issue`, `help-wanted`, `expert-needed`

### Issue Lifecycle
1. **Created**: Issue is submitted
2. **Triaged**: Maintainers review and label
3. **Assigned**: Developer takes ownership
4. **In Progress**: Work begins
5. **Review**: Pull request submitted
6. **Resolved**: Issue is closed

## Security Considerations

### Sensitive Information
- **Never commit**: API keys, private keys, passwords
- **Use secrets management**: Environment variables for sensitive data
- **Review carefully**: All changes that touch authentication/authorization
- **Report privately**: Security vulnerabilities should not be public

### Security Review Process
- **Automated scanning**: CodeQL and security audits run on all PRs
- **Manual review**: Security-sensitive changes get additional review
- **Dependency updates**: Regular updates to address vulnerabilities
- **Incident response**: Clear process for handling security issues

## Quality Assurance

### Automated Quality Checks
- **Linting**: ESLint for code style and potential issues
- **Type Checking**: TypeScript for type safety
- **Testing**: Jest for unit and integration tests
- **Coverage**: Minimum test coverage requirements
- **Security**: Automated vulnerability scanning

### Manual Quality Assurance
- **Code Review**: Human review of all changes
- **Testing**: Manual testing of new features
- **Documentation**: Ensure docs are updated
- **User Experience**: Consider impact on end users

## Communication

### Channels
- **GitHub Issues**: Bug reports and feature requests
- **GitHub Discussions**: Community questions and ideas
- **Pull Request Comments**: Code-specific discussions
- **Discord/Slack**: Real-time community chat (if applicable)

### Best Practices
- **Be respectful**: Follow code of conduct
- **Be constructive**: Provide helpful feedback
- **Be patient**: Allow time for responses
- **Be clear**: Communicate clearly and concisely

## Metrics & Monitoring

### Repository Health Metrics
- **Pull Request Velocity**: Time from creation to merge
- **Issue Resolution Time**: Time from creation to closure
- **Code Coverage**: Percentage of code covered by tests
- **Security Vulnerabilities**: Number and severity of open vulnerabilities
- **Community Engagement**: Number of contributors and contributions

### Continuous Improvement

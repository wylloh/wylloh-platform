# 🎪 Welcome to the Wylloh Beta!

## 🎬 You're Part of Something Historic

Welcome to the **Wylloh Beta** - where we're experimenting with the future of creator-owned content! You're among the first to experience blockchain-powered film ownership.

## 🚀 What You're Joining

**This is a Beta Experiment** - We're a bootstrapped startup testing new ideas with:
- **Public domain content** (starting with "The Cocoanuts" from 1929)
- **Real blockchain technology** on Polygon mainnet
- **Experimental features** that may evolve rapidly
- **A single founder** (Harrison) learning and building in real-time

## 💡 What to Expect

**The Good Stuff:**
- ✅ Own actual blockchain tokens for classic films
- ✅ Support innovative creator economics (95% to creators!)
- ✅ Be part of Web3 entertainment history
- ✅ Help shape the future of content ownership

**The Reality Check:**
- ⚠️ This is experimental software - bugs may happen
- ⚠️ Features may change as we learn and improve
- ⚠️ We're bootstrap-funded with limited resources
- ⚠️ Blockchain transactions are permanent (no "undo" button)

## 🎯 Our Commitment

**What We Promise:**
- 🤝 Complete transparency about our progress
- 💻 Best effort to keep everything running smoothly
- 📧 Direct communication when issues arise
- 🔧 Continuous improvement based on your feedback

**What We Can't Promise:**
- 🚫 Perfect uptime (we're learning!)
- 🚫 Reversing blockchain transactions
- 🚫 Recovering funds from user errors
- 🚫 Enterprise-level support (it's just Harrison for now!)

## 🎭 Low-Stakes Learning

We chose **public domain films** specifically to keep things low-risk while we perfect the technology. Think of this as a **friendly experiment** rather than a high-stakes investment.

## 🤝 Participate at Your Own Pace

- **No pressure** - only participate if you're excited about the experiment
- **Small amounts** - we recommend starting with just one token ($4.99)
- **Optional participation** - you can stop anytime
- **Learning together** - we're all figuring this out as we go

## 📞 Questions or Issues?

Harrison is directly available for any questions or concerns. We're building this together!

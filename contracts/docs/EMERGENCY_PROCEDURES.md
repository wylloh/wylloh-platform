## 💰 FUND RECOVERY PROCEDURES

### **User Fund Protection**
Since WyllohFilmRegistry is non-upgradeable, fund recovery options are limited:

- Implement warnings and safeguards

#### **Option 2: New Contract Deployment**
```
MIGRATION PROCESS:
1. Deploy fixed WyllohFilmRegistry contract
2. Snapshot current token holders
3. Airdrop equivalent tokens on new contract
4. Migrate creator balances
5. Update all frontend references
6. Sunset old contract
```

#### **Option 3: Community Coordination**
- Emergency multisig for creator payouts
- Manual token distribution
